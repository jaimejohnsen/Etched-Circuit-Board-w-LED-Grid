# Etched-Circuit-Board-w-LED-Grid

The circuit design was laser printed to paper with a plastic film allowing it to be heat transferred to a circuit board.
Then the board was submerged in an acid solution to remove the unnecessary copper plating.
Through holes were drilled using the router table.
The LED grid and resistors were soldered to the board.
Where the laser print did not entirely transfer additional wires were improvised and soldered to make the connection.
The areas where the laser print did not transfer was caused during the heat transfer process. Additional padding is necessary to evenly distribute the weight and heat of the heat plate.
Jumper wires connected the PCB to the TI MSP430
The blink.c file used C, machine code and hex to display alternating images of Smiley Face and Sad Face using the switch.
